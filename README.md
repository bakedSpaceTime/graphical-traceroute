# graphical-traceroute

Track changes in network traceroutes graphically over time with a friendly web interface built on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), pulling traceroutes from [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Network Exporter](https://github.com/syepes/network_exporter) in the backend. Requires an existing Prometheus/Network Exporter setup.
